Upon entering the van, the couples hands were tied with rope, and Richard was clubbed into unconsciousness with a wrench, while one of the perpetrators sexually assaulted Quita.

Quita was killed by several slashes from the machete-like blade; Richard survived, but was badly mutilated by slashes in his face and he was robbed of his wallet. Two of the perpetrators, Jesse Cooks and Larry Green, were found, charged and in March 1976, convicted for the kidnapping, armed assault, robbery, and murder.  The third perpetrator, Anthony C. Harris, was given immunity at the trial in exchange for his testimony.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.

As she yelled, another car then drive toward DeMartini in an attempt to kill her, but she rolled herself under the Mustang to dodge the .32 caliber bullets, and thus survived.

She responded with the same and then started up the stairs, at which point the man shot McMillian in the back two times with a .32 caliber gun; the first shot passed through her body, and the second hit her spine, paralyzing her from the waist down as she collapsed to the floor.  McMillian survived the attack, but was left paralyzed for the rest of her life.  She was the only one of the Zebra killers' five victims on this night in late January that survived.  The perpetrators, later identified as J.C. Simon and Manuel Moore, then fled to Moore's Cadillac, where Anthony Harris was waiting for them, and the three sped off.
